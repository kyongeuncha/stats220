# Hi there! I'm Kelly.

I will be displaying my understanding of the content in STATS 220 here.

*This course is being completed during semester one of 2024*

## The purpose of this repository

I am currently taking STATS 220 at the University of Auckland.
The purpose of this repo is to host and store projects for this course.

This is a list of why I think this course will be so much fun.
- **Memes**: I love how all the lab tasks and lectures are filled with memes!!
- **Interactive Lectures**: The lectures have been so much fun to attend because of the interactive component to them! They are so much more engaging this way.
- **Our Lecturer**: Anna is simply the best lecturer!!

This is an ordered list of the projects I will be completing:
1. Project 1
2. Project 2
3. Project 3
4. Project 4
5. Project 5
